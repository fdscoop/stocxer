# Minimal requirements for Vercel deployment
# This excludes heavy ML training libraries (200MB+)
# Models should be pre-trained and API should only serve predictions

# Note: ML libraries (scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm, scipy, matplotlib, plotly)
# are excluded from production to reduce deployment size from 314MB to ~50MB
# If you need ML predictions, pre-train models and load them, or use a separate ML service
